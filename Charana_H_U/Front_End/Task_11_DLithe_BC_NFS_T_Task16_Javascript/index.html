        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. It is
            designed to make client-side Web development easier, more efficient, and fun. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm
            language
            <br>It supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
            behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
        <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
